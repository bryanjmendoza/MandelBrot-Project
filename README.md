# MandelBrot-Project

MandelBrot Image generator created in C using IPC. Uses Unix/Linux system calls.
This projetc uses various IPC resources for Unix systems and the C
library to create Mandelbrot images.

To run the program you can do ./mandelbrot at the command line using Unix/Linux shell.

You can use the Xmax, Xmin, Ymax, and Ymin values to zoom in or out of the mandelbrot
image. You can even save the image to a file if you want, but it is not necessary.

A good set of values to input would be to see a nice Mandelbrot image

a created file name or anything when prompted to enter a file

Xmin = -1.5
Xmax = 1.5
Ymin = -1.0
Ymax = 1.0

Rows = 50
Columns = 100

Max Iterations = 100
